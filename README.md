# Consolidated Data Processing Project

This project includes scripts for processing and analyzing CSV data files, specifically designed for financial and food-related data. It's aimed at individuals or businesses looking to automate the consolidation of various data points from multiple sources into a singular, manageable format.

## Description

The project comprises two main scripts: `add_all.py` and `calculatefood.py`.
